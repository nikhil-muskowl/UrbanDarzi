                                The idea for Urban Darzi started with a lack of an overall satisfaction when buying clothes today in terms of style, fit,
                                pricing and service.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text-justify">Today, while shopping in high streets or in malls, the clothes available are made in a predefined
                                fit created out of a model mannequin in styles that are chosen for us by designers who do
                                not know what we like or dislike. We go after brands, that offer no after-sales service if
                                something goes wrong with the product. Moreover, we get all this at prices that make a hole
                                in our pocket for average quality. To add to all of this, we spend so much time to get that
                                one piece of clothing right either online or in malls.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Urban Darzi was born out of this predicament.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text-justify">With life becoming busier day-by-day, I felt there is a need for a brand
                                    that knows my style statement, my desired fit and that believes in the
                                    idea of looking good!
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text-justify">Someone whom I can trust for creating a wardrobe that reflects me, my
                                    individual style and makes me look good, while I go about my daily life
                                    & that is how Urban Darzi came along.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="text-justify">I started Urban Darzi to create a paradigm shift in the way we shop for
                                    clothes today. With everyday clothing bespoke to our style and our fit,
                                    at affordable prices, why will we want to have off-the-rack regular
                                    clothes anymore?!
